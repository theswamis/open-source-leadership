# Organize
Removing obstacles from in front of your team enables them do their best work.

# Why Organize?
> Rule 1 for humans: The easier it is for people to do something, the more they will do it. 
Corollary to rule 1: If you want people to do more of something make it easier, not harder.
Fix the environment, not people.

Organization helps the team become more efficient and productive.  The less people struggle and the more they can see results, the more motivated they will be.

Organization involves Roles and Responsibilities.  For key roles such as scrummaster, product owner, make sure to clearly identify people who have the ability and interest to do the job.  In some cases, this will result in an "org chart" but the key is to understand ownership of each responsibility.

# Take Action
1. Find one area of disorganization or inefficiency and fix it.
2. List the important roles for your organization.  Put names of people next to each role.  Identify one gap and find a solution.

# Questions
1. What obstacles prevent us from doing our work?
2. How can we make our work more efficient?
3. Are there gaps in our role assignments?  Is anyone overloaded?  Is everyone doing what they want to do?
