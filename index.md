# Who is this for?
If you have followers, you are a leader.  This includes parents, teachers, community organizers, volunteer coordinators, and the list goes on.  You are almost certainly a leader in some sphere of life.

You don't have to be a manager to be a leader.
Some people are formally title as "managers" in their job.  While that comes with specific responsibilties for hiring, firing, and compensation, leading people is the core skill.  The greatest leaders in history influenced people to follow them not by their title, but by their words and actions.
