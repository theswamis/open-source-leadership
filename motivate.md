# Motivate
> the condition of being eager to act or work [Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/motivation)

# Why Motivate?
As a leader, one of our key roles is to motivate people to accomplish a goal or task.
Daniel Pink gives an excellent overview of our motivations in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc).

Often, we think of rewards or punishments as ways to motivate people.  Give a bonus to get more of something, or threaten people if they fail in some way.

The 3 key ways to motivate people are:
1. Autonomy
2. Mastery
3. Purpose

# Take Action
1. Choose an important task your team needs to accomplish.
2. Write your thoughts about how to motivate your team to accomplish the goal.  Incorporate autonomy, mastery and purpose as you think about how to motivate your team. 
3. Share your thoughts with your team and other leaders to get their feedback.  Ask them if your thoughts are motivating.

# Questions
- What could we do to make this a more inspiring place to work?
- What demotivates you?
- What do you want to learn and master?  How can we help you do that?
