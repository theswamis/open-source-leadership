# Why Inspire?
People want to know that their work has meaning.

Think about a time when you were so excited about your work, you lost track of time.  

# Change you can implement today in your team


# Questions to ask your team in groups or 1/1s
- What could we do to make this a more inspiring place to work?
- Who are we helping with our work?  What else can we do to help them?
