# Prioritize
Choosing what to work on and what not to work on.

# Why Prioritize
Every team has limited resources and unlimited requests.
We constantly prioritize consciously or subconsciously.

These are some benefits of prioritization:
1. Priorities unify the organization.
2. Priorities help the organization achieve its objectives and purpose.
3. Priorities identify resource gaps.

# Take Action
1. List the priorities for your organization.
2. Evaluate the priorities based on the [purpose](purpose.md) of your organization.
3. Share your priorities and evaluation with your team and get their feedback.

# Questions
1. What criteria do we use to prioritize our work?
2. Have we prioritized incorrectly?
