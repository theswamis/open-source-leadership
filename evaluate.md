# Evaluate
The goal of this entire process of performance evaluation is to improve the way a team or an organization functions, to achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction.

# Why Evaluate?
"Trust but verify"

After prioritizing and delegating, the job is not done.  You must make sure that the goals are being accomplished.

Evaluation takes place on at least these two dimensions:
1. Metrics and Results.  The objective, measurable results should be the starting point.  What number, date, or other target was given when the project started?
2. Values.  Your previously agreed upon values influence if the person or project did the work in the right way.  For example, if "Trust" is a value for the organization, a person who lied or cheated to meet their goal has failed. 

# Take Action
1. Pick one person on your team.  Evaluate their performance based on your goals and values.
2. Evaluate your evaluation.  Were you objective?  Did the person know what was expected?
3. Communicate your evaluation to the person.  How can you share the information clearly in a way that will be well-received?
