# Recruit
Identify and motivate people who share your purpose to join your team.

# Why Recruit?
> By making recruiting an ongoing process and continually connecting with people you think could be a good fit for your organization, when an open job does come across your desk, you’ll already have a roster of qualified candidates in your contact list. That way you won’t have to scramble and start from scratch to find the right person for the position.
>“Cultivating relationships with a diverse slate of potential candidates allows a wider pool of potential candidates in the queue to consider once there is a position to be filled,” noted Lanza.
>To be a really effective hiring manager, you need to be reaching out to potential candidates, building relationships, and getting the word out about why your organization is such a great place to work on a regular basis, regardless of whether or not you have an open role to fill.
