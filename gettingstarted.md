# Getting Started
This is meant to be a practical, action-oriented guide for new and aspiring leaders.
Here are some ways to make the most of this guide.

## Start at the Very Beginning
The topics are roughly in the order of importance.  You can start with [Purpose](purpose.md) and go down the list from top to bottom.

## Ask For Input
Ask your leader or mentor which topic they suggest for you to focus on.
Work on it and get feedback from peers or other leaders.
Then come back for more.

## Self Evaluation
1. Skim each section.
2. Pick one that seems most relevant to your situation.
3. Take action to improve.
