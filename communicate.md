# Communicate
Your followers need you to clearly communicate in a way that they can understand.

# Why Communicate?
No one can read your mind!

Your followers want and need to hear your ideas.  Your message about purpose, vision, and action is of no use if not communnicated with your followers.
Don't be shy, they want to hear from you.

_It is impossible to overcommunicate._

# Take Action
1. Send one communication to your team every week (at least).  Example topics include:
- A hot topic of interest to the team
- Something you are learning
- Celebrations and successes
- Opportunities and challenges

2. Speak up in meetings.  Make a goal to ask 1 question or make one statement in every meeting you attend.  This shows that you are engaged and contributing.  Your perspective is important.
