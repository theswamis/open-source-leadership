# Purpose
Purpose gives meaning and direction to your activity.  Activity without direction quickly becomes tiresome and people will quit.

# Why Purpose?
People want to know that their work has meaning and purpose.

Think about recruiting people to join your team.  What do you tell them?  It is usually related to the purpose of your team.  If you have a strong purpose, then recruiting will become easier.

Companies often express their purpose as a mission statement.  Here are a few [examples](https://alessiobresciani.com/foresight-strategy/51-mission-statement-examples-from-the-worlds-best-companies/).
Notice how most of the statements talk about the people they serve and how they want to improve their lives.

# Take Action
Write down the purpose of your team or group in one sentence.  Share it with your team and get their feedback.

Most often, strong purpose comes from helping others.  Showing how your work impacts the lives of others and the world around you is most often the purpose of your team or organization.  Think about who benefits from your work and tie your purpose to helping them.

# Questions to Ask Your Team
- What could we do to make this a more inspiring place to work?
- Who are we helping with our work?  What else can we do to help them?
- Is our purpose inspiring and motivating?  Why or why not?
- Does the work you do on a daily basis align with our purpose?
- What are the obstacles to reaching your purpose?
