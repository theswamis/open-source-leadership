# Decide
The process of making choices.

# Why Decide?
Your team and organization is the product of your decisions.
The process of making decisions is crucial to your success as a leader.

These are some factors to consider when thinking about making decisions:
1. Speed.  How fast do you make decisions?  Do some decisions take longer than others?
2. People.  Who are the decision makers?
3. Criteria.  How do we decide?  Is there a standard process for presenting options and making a decision?

# Take Action
1. Think of one major decision you had to make recently.  Write down the steps involved to reach a decision.
2. Write your thoughts on how the process could improve.
3. Ask your team to provide their feedback on the process.

# Questions
1. How might we improve our decision making?
2. How can we make our work more efficient?
3. Are there gaps in our role assignments?  Is anyone overloaded?  Is everyone doing what they want to do?
