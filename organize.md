# Organize
Removing obstacles from in front of your team enables them do their best work.

# Why Organize?
> Rule 1 for humans: The easier it is for people to do something, the more they will do it. 
Corollary to rule 1: If you want people to do more of something make it easier, not harder.
Fix the environment, not people.
