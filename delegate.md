> Identify and motivate people who share your purpose to join your team.

# Why Delegate?
Delegation is difficult.
1. You want the team to take ownership of jobs, so that the organization can grow.
2. Your team wants responsibility.  They want to take on challenges and succeed.
3. You want to maintain quality and ensure things are done properly.

When you delegate:
1. Give the power with the responsibility.  Don't make someone repsonsible for a task without giving them the power to make it happen.
2. Focus on the "what" the goal is more than "how" the job is done.  Explain how you will evaluate the results and then give freedom to the person to create a solution.  This will empower them to find creative solutions and also free you from managing every detail of the job. 

# Take Action
1. Pick one important task that you do and delegate it to someone on your team.  Choose the person wisely.  Clearly communicate the expectations including dates or metrics.
2. Set a date to evaluate the progress and give feedback.
